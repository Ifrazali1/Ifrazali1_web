    <h2>What The Movie Was About</h2>


    <p>According to the In a World Guy, who narrates the trailer, the movie takes place "In a world . . . beyond the law.<br>" It stars Vin Diesel, the bald-headed, mug-faced action actor who looks like a muscular Otto Preminger.He plays <br>Toretto, a star
        of the forbidden sport of street racing, and rockets his custom machine through Los Angeles at<br> more than 100 mph before pushing a button on the dashboard and really accelerating, thanks to a nitrous oxide<br> booster. He also runs a bar where
        his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) serves "tuna salad on white <br>bread, no crusts" every day to Brian (Paul Walker), who looks a little like white bread, no crusts himself.</p>
